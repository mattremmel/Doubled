# Doubled

Doubled is an iOS game inspired by the game 2048. It's based on a similar concept but has different game mechanics. This project started as a way to learn Apples (new at the time) Swift programming language. I was able to get a proof of concept working in Swift, but started hitting road blocks when trying to finish because the language was incomplete and still in beta. I spent a weekend porting the project back to Objective-C, and then a couple more months polishing it up. It is currently available on the App Store under the name 'Doubled'.

### Features:
- Multiple Game Modes
- Comprehensive Game Statistics
- iCloud Synchronization for Scores
- Game Center Integration
- Secured Data Storage to Prevent Tampering

There are likely code smells and other areas for improvement in this project, since it was my first attempt at building a full featured app, and my first exposure to Apple's SpriteKit. One day I may overhaul and refactor the project, but i've archived it for now.
