/*
 Create clear rectangle node the size specified. The bar is a child node added to draw the slider but has no functions. The slider button is a child node added to draw the button but has no function. When touched, the containing node adjusts the positions of the child button to reflect where the user is touching. Can add position tolerance code to force the users to touch closer to the button. Value is based on 100 divided across the size of the slider.\
